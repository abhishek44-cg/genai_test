If Supplier is based in France this should be amended to 45\\n\\nConfidential\\n\\ndays and should be amended to 75 days if Supplier is outside of the EU or Switzerland, Norway or UK. Please also see the AZ CAN Handbook for further explanation.\\nYou can use the following wording:\\n\\n#.1.\\n\\n“Upfront payment.

It may have also negative tax consequences.\\n\\nCONTRACTUAL CLAUSES WORDING\\n\\nCompensation\\nPayment Term Clause indicates a deadline to make payment under the Agreement, Purchase Order or Statement of Work. Our standard payment term is 75 days (but 60 days in the UK and the EU). AstraZeneca (as a payer) always prefers applicable maximum standard payment term as it enables better management of financial liquidity.\\n\\nDo not make payments without valid PO.\\n\\nSome countries have shorter maximum payment terms. Too long payment terms may result in tax and competition risks.\\nAZ in general does not agree to shorten the payment term. It also applies to the case where 75-days payment period is our standard and the Vendor wants to shorten it to 65 days.\\n\\nFirstly, please check whether the maximum payment term is not shorted due to more restrictive applicable laws (see Deep Dive).\\nSometimes AstraZeneca may include the Late Payment Clause in the agreement to indicate interest in case of delay in payments. However, in some countries late payment arises directly from mandatory laws so please never expressly exclude such provisions in the agreement (remain silent).\\n\\nKEY ISSUES TO BE CONSIDERED\\n\\nShall the payment term be shorter than our standard payment term because of more restrictive applicable laws?\\n\\nWhat is the rationale behind the Vendor’s demand to shorten payment term?\\nAstraZeneca (as a payer) always prefers applicable maximum standard payment term as it enables better management of financial liquidity. However, late payment negatively affects supplier’s liquidity, competitiveness and complicates their financial management of undertakings (i.e. need to obtain external financing). This risk strongly increases in periods of economic downturn (i.e. COVID-19 pandemic). Due to this fact, the EU introduced various maximum standard payment terms.',\n",

The Parties agree that there is a need\\n\\nto make an upfront payment of the sum [currency +\\n\\namount] for the [name of the activity] as set out in this\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\n6\\n\\nLate Payments\\n\\nSupplier payments agreement.\\n\\ninsists\\n\\nto\\n\\nlanguage\\n\\ninclude\\n\\nin\\n\\nlate the\\n\\nElectronic transactions\\n\\nSome Vendors do not want to use Coupa (CSP).\\n\\nPartial Payment\\n\\nto oblige Some Vendors AstraZeneca to make a partial payment of an invoice to the non- disputed extent.\\n\\ntry\\nPayment Term Clause indicates a deadline to make payment under the Agreement, Purchase Order or Statement of Work. Our standard payment term is 75 days (but 60 days in the UK and the EU). AstraZeneca (as a payer) always prefers applicable maximum standard payment term as it enables better management of financial liquidity.\\n\\nDo not make payments without valid PO.\\n\\nSome countries have shorter maximum payment terms. Too long payment terms may result in tax and competition risks.\\nAZ in general does not agree to shorten the payment term. It also applies to the case where 75-days payment period is our standard and the Vendor wants to shorten it to 65 days.\\n\\nFirstly, please check whether the maximum payment term is not shorted due to more restrictive applicable laws (see Deep Dive).\\nThe MSA contains AZ’s preferred position on payment i.e.: that AZ will have 60 days to make payment (assuming Supplier is based in the EU, Switzerland, Norway or UK). If Supplier is based in France this should be amended to 45\\n\\nConfidential\\n\\ndays and should be amended to 75 days if Supplier is outside of the EU or Switzerland, Norway or UK. Please also see the AZ CAN Handbook for further explanation.\\nAstraZeneca (as a payer) always prefers applicable maximum standard payment term as it enables better management of financial liquidity. However, late payment negatively affects supplier’s liquidity, competitiveness and complicates their financial management of undertakings (i.e. need to obtain external financing). This risk strongly increases in periods of economic downturn (i.e. COVID-19 pandemic). Due to this fact, the EU introduced various maximum standard payment terms.\\nSometimes AstraZeneca may include the Late Payment Clause in the agreement to indicate interest in case of delay in payments. However, in some countries late payment arises directly from mandatory laws so please never expressly exclude such provisions in the agreement (remain silent).\\n\\nKEY ISSUES TO BE CONSIDERED\\n\\nShall the payment term be shorter than our standard payment term because of more restrictive applicable laws?\\n\\nWhat is the rationale behind the Vendor’s demand to shorten payment term?',\n",

For high risk contracts, you should seek to retain the long form audit clause and agree to minimal amendments.

It is a business decision. It is acceptable in case of one-off cooperation.

You will need to discuss this with your Procurement/ Business Partner.\\n\\nConfidential\\nAZ has decided that the starting position in every MSA should be to include a cap on the liability of Supplier so as to reduce negotiation time. However, in the high risk liability clause (set out below) there are a number of areas where the liability position of Supplier is uncapped e.g.: for data protection, cyber security, IPR, confidentiality, under indemnities, TUPE (i.e.: the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 which is in relation to staff transferring from one entity\\nThe level of the cap is always a business decision.

That is why AZ has to inquire about subcontractors to know who is the ultimate beneficiary of the payments from AZ. Sometimes Vendors may argue that due to the specificity of services provided or Vendor’s model of work, AZ consent will be required more often and faster to be able to provide services smoothly.

Please pay a special attention on the definition of Employees as for the purposes of this clause it should not include contractors (freelancers). Such people are usually micro-entrepreneurs which should have wide freedom to operate and compete under the competition laws’ rules.\\n\\nUseful links\\n\\nSUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS\\nIf the Vendor doesn’t foresee any subcontracting then this clause shall not pose any problems as it will not be used. Ultimately, if the Vendor is absolutely sure no subcontractors will be used, the clause may be replaced with the following clause: “Subcontracting. [Vendor] will not subcontract its obligations under this Agreement to any third party including any Affiliate.”\\n\\n2 Who has to give written consent for\\n\\nengagement of subcontractor?\\nAZ’s starting position should always be that suppliers cannot sub-contract unless they have AZ’s prior written consent. This is important to ensure AZ has visibility on who it is engaging to perform services and supply goods. Changes to this starting position should be agreed with the Business. Where sub-contracting is permitted, consider including a defined list of approved sub-contractors.\\n\\nAlways ensure the supplier is responsible for the acts and omissions of its sub-contractors.\\n1. Subcontracting possible only after AZ’s prior written approval requested by an email. 2. Subcontractor to be bound by the same standards as Supplier incl. Confidentiality. 3. Removal of any employee, contractor, subcontractor at justified concerns from AZ.\\n\\nFALL BACK POSITION\\n\\n1. Permitted Subcontractors & Key personnel to be listed in the agreement and AZ provides consent by signing an agreement.\\nActually the clause states that Vendor may engage subcontractors provided that AZ has given its consent to such engagement. Vendor has to be liable for subcontractors actions as AZ doesn’t have any contractual relation with subcontractors. Vendor having the contractual relation with subcontractor will be able to claim back from subcontractor for the damage repaired to AZ.\\n\\nUseful links\\n\\nSUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS\\n\\nGlobal Legal Templates Repository\\n\\nGPS Legal LegalGPS@astrazeneca.com • Global Legal\\nThis is needed exactly for the purpose of transparency and good conduct. AZ cannot accept Vendor’s employee or subcontractor in case there are justified reasons that such person will cause damage (financial or reputational to AZ).\\n\\n7 Why does the clause say that the supplier may have subcontractors and they must obey the same rights as the supplier (included in the contract) and the supplier for managing the subcontractor, taking self-verification (due diligence)?\\n\\nis\\n\\nresponsible\\nAs the last resort option and only for subcontractor being a natural person, it can be acceptable to have an opposing mechanism stating that supplier needs to notify AZ about such subcontractor and AZ has at least 14 days to disagree to such choice (providing a rationale behind such decision). Please note, however, that AZ avoids contracting with natural persons on other grounds than employment contracts.\",\n",

       "  'ground_truth': \"AstraZeneca's standard payment term is 75 days. However, for transactions in which the vendor is located in the EU, Switzerland, Norway, or the UK, a 60-day payment term is applied. An exception is made for suppliers located in France, where a 45-day payment term is applied.\",\n",
       "  'response': 'The standard payment term for AstraZeneca is 75 days, but it is 60 days in the UK and the EU. AstraZeneca prefers to adhere to the applicable maximum standard payment term as it allows for better management of financial liquidity. However, it is important to note that some countries may have shorter maximum payment terms.',\n",
       "  'context': 'an individual invoice to be paid outside of agreed payment terms - Early Payment Request via Ask AZ must be submitted;\\n\\nany exception to the AstraZeneca standard payment terms (Matrix) - Payment Terms Exception Request Form must be submitted.\\n\\nEarly (shorter) payment terms must be equal to 0, 15, 30, 45 or 60 days. For example, 21-days as a payment term would not be acceptable.\\nAZ in general does not agree to shorten the payment term. It also applies to the case where 75-days payment period is our standard and the Vendor wants to shorten it to 65 days.\\n\\nFirstly, please check whether the maximum payment term is not shorted due to more restrictive applicable laws (see Deep Dive).\\nAstraZeneca (as a payer) always prefers applicable maximum standard payment term as it enables better management of financial liquidity. However, late payment negatively affects supplier’s liquidity, competitiveness and complicates their financial management of undertakings (i.e. need to obtain external financing). This risk strongly increases in periods of economic downturn (i.e. COVID-19 pandemic). Due to this fact, the EU introduced various maximum standard payment terms.\\nHas Vendor sent their standard terms and conditions with their\\n\\nDEFINITIONS\\n\\n[Taken from the AZ standard terms and conditions for use in UK]\\nPayment Term Clause indicates a deadline to make payment under the Agreement, Purchase Order or Statement of Work. Our standard payment term is 75 days (but 60 days in the UK and the EU). AstraZeneca (as a payer) always prefers applicable maximum standard payment term as it enables better management of financial liquidity.\\n\\nDo not make payments without valid PO.\\n\\nSome countries have shorter maximum payment terms. Too long payment terms may result in tax and competition risks.\\nThe MSA contains AZ’s preferred position on payment i.e.: that AZ will have 60 days to make payment (assuming Supplier is based in the EU, Switzerland, Norway or UK). If Supplier is based in France this should be amended to 45\\n\\nConfidential\\n\\ndays and should be amended to 75 days if Supplier is outside of the EU or Switzerland, Norway or UK. Please also see the AZ CAN Handbook for further explanation.\\nAZ is given wide rights to terminate the contract including at any time on giving 7 Business Days’ Notice. Depending on the commercial deal, this may be rejected by Supplier as it may require a longer guarantee of revenue.\\nWe have two options: 1. Accept to do business on the Vendor’s standard terms 2. Reject the Vendor’s standard terms and assert the AZ terms.\\n\\nWhere option 1 is chosen, the Vendor’s terms must be reviewed first and amended where necessary to protect AZ and mitigate risk. This will take time and resource. For that reason, it is advisable to select option 2 and reject the Vendor’s terms and assert the AZ terms.\\n\\nPage 22 of 144\\n\\nCOMMON QUESTIONS & PUSH BACKS\\n\\nQs & PUSHBACKS 1.

Access to documentation and information: AstraZeneca should be able to request and obtain relevant documentation and information from the supplier to verify their compliance with the contract.\\n\\n3.

The supplier will be liable for the acts and omissions of each Supplier Party as though such acts and omissions were carried out by the supplier.\",\n",

This is the starting position for AstraZeneca, and any changes to this position should be agreed upon with the business. If sub-contracting is permitted, the supplier should ensure that the sub-contractors are reputable and responsible for their acts and omissions. The terms of the sub-contract should be no less onerous than those set out in the agreement between AstraZeneca and the supplier.\",\n",
       "  'context': \"AZ’s starting position should always be that suppliers cannot sub-contract unless they have AZ’s prior written consent. This is important to ensure AZ has visibility on who it is engaging to perform services and supply goods. Changes to this starting position should be agreed with the Business. Where sub-contracting is permitted, consider including a defined list of approved sub-contractors.\\n\\nAlways ensure the supplier is responsible for the acts and omissions of its sub-contractors.\\n3. Subcontracting Supplier may use reputable Subcontractors to fulfil its obligations under this Agreement subject to the terms of this Clause 3. Prior to engaging any Subcontractor, or making any additions or replacements to any Subcontractor approved by AstraZeneca, Supplier shall inform AstraZeneca in writing of the same and promptly provide AstraZeneca with any detail in respect to Supplier’s use of Subcontractors as may be reasonably requested by AstraZeneca.. In the event AstraZeneca, acting\\nSupplier may only sub-contract its obligations under this Agreement with AZ’s prior written consent. Supplier will ensure that any sub-contract will be on terms which are no less onerous than those set out in this Agreement.\\nMake sure that project owner designates the right person to make decision on inclusion of subcontractors at the request of Vendor. If subcontractor is HCO or HCP you should apply Transparency Rules.\\n\\nKEY ISSUES TO BE CONSIDERED\\n\\nIs the supplier permitted to sub-contract to third parties freely (not advisable) or does this require AZ's prior written consent (advisable)?\\n24.1 The Supplier will not be entitled to sub-contract, assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written Agreement of AstraZeneca. If AstraZeneca provides written consent for the Supplier to sub-contract any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement the Supplier may only do so if (a) AstraZeneca has approved both the identity of the proposed sub-contractor and the scope of work to be undertaken by that sub-contractor in advance in writing,\\nAs the last resort option and only for subcontractor being a natural person, it can be acceptable to have an opposing mechanism stating that supplier needs to notify AZ about such subcontractor and AZ has at least 14 days to disagree to such choice (providing a rationale behind such decision). Please note, however, that AZ avoids contracting with natural persons on other grounds than employment contracts.\\n1. Subcontracting possible only after AZ’s prior written approval requested by an email. 2. Subcontractor to be bound by the same standards as Supplier incl. Confidentiality. 3. Removal of any employee, contractor, subcontractor at justified concerns from AZ.\\n\\nFALL BACK POSITION\\n\\n1. Permitted Subcontractors & Key personnel to be listed in the agreement and AZ provides consent by signing an agreement.\\nAlso always ensure the contract is clear that any sub-contractors should be bound by terms and conditions consistent with AZ’s main agreement with the supplier. Vendors often try to avoid the requirement of AZ’s prior written consent. However, that should be a standard and a general rule. The key reason behind AZ’s consent are: ABAC rules and transparency of pharmaceutical industry relations with health care organizations and health care Vendors. That is why AZ has to inquire about subcontractors to know\\nits approval of a sub-contractor if in AstraZeneca’s reasonable opinion: (a) the sub-contractor’s performance is materially deficient and/or causes the Supplier to be in material breach of this Agreement, (b) the sub-contractor breaches any of its confidentiality or data protection or intellectual property obligations; or (c) there have been any material misrepresentations by or concerning the sub-contractor.\\nReferences to the Supplier in these Terms includes any Authorised Sub-Processors. References to obligations on the Supplier, include the Supplier procuring that the Authorised Sub-Processor shall also be obliged to undertake the requisite obligation.\",\n",

       "  'ground_truth': 'The breach of confidentiality provisions may result in unlimited liability, meaning it is outside of any agreed caps and is uncapped. This could potentially lead to significant financial consequences. Additionally, an unauthorized disclosure of confidential information may also be considered a criminal offence in some jurisdictions.',\n",
       "  'response': 'The risk of breaching a confidentiality clause can vary depending on the specific circumstances and the terms of the agreement. However, in general, the breach of a confidentiality clause can result in the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, which can have several negative consequences:\\n\\n1. Legal consequences: Breaching a confidentiality clause can lead to legal action, including lawsuits for damages or injunctions to prevent further disclosure. The party that breached the clause may be held liable for any losses or damages suffered by the other party as a result of the breach.\\n\\n2. Reputational damage: Unauthorized disclosure of confidential information can harm the reputation of the party responsible for the breach. This can lead to a loss of trust and credibility among business partners, customers, and stakeholders.\\n\\n3. Competitive disadvantage: If confidential information is disclosed to competitors, it can give them an unfair advantage in the market. This can result in lost business opportunities, decreased market share, and reduced profitability for the party whose information was disclosed.\\n\\n4. Loss of trade secrets or intellectual property: Confidential information often includes trade secrets, proprietary knowledge, or intellectual property. Breaching the confidentiality clause can lead to the loss or theft of these valuable assets, which can be difficult or impossible to recover.\\n\\n5. Regulatory and compliance issues: Depending on the nature of the confidential information, a breach of the confidentiality clause may also result in regulatory or compliance violations. This can lead to fines, penalties, or other legal consequences imposed by regulatory authorities.\\n\\nIt is important to carefully consider and manage the risks associated with breaching a confidentiality clause to protect the interests of all parties involved.',\n",

       "  'context': 'Has Vendor sent their standard terms and conditions with their\\n\\nDEFINITIONS\\n\\n[Taken from the AZ standard terms and conditions for use in UK]\\nhat the General Terms should be amended is if this is needed to deal with local jurisdictional requirements, for example, payment terms or invoicing terms or modifications due to local legal or regulatory requirements.\\nThe wording set out above which is included in the AstraZeneca standard terms and conditions is helpful in situations where those terms are used and the Vendor sends their own standard terms with the delivery of goods or in acceptance of the purchase order. However, we cannot solely rely on that since the Vendor’s terms are very likely to contain wording stating that their terms apply to the delivery and our acceptance of the delivery constitutes acceptance of the Vendor’s terms and conditions.\\nIf a term has a specific meaning in a part of an agreement (e.g. Patient is understood differently in provisions related to adverse reactions and differently in other parts of the agreement, such distinction shall be made clear e.g. “for the purpose of this paragpraph only, the term “patient” shall mean…”).\\n\\nUseful links\\n\\nSUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS\\n\\nGlobal Legal Templates Repository • LEGAL ENGLISH VOCABULARY –\\n\\nGPS Legal LegalGPS@astrazeneca.com • Global Legal\\n\\nCONTRACTS IN GLOBAL PROCUREMENT\\nprior to 2021. Please check with Group Treasury on any proposed language deviation or the relevance of such language in more complex Business Development deals.\\nINTRODUCTORY REMARKS\\n\\nIf the term starts with a capital letter, there should be a definition of such term and it may be understood differently than in common language.\\n\\nDo not insert any\\n\\nnormative language (“must”, “shall”, “should”) into the definition, but to the body of an agreement.\\nIt is a bad practice to include any normative language in the definitions, e.g. “Services” shall be understood as any service provided by company X to company Y under the terms of this agreement. Detailed scope of Services will be agreed by the Parties. AstraZeneca should never accept to pay for Services not delivered in accordance to this agreement.” Such normative provisions (underlined) shall be the part of a “body” of an agreement.\\nBATTLE OF THE FORMS – RISK WITH USING PURCHASE ORDER TERMS\\n\\nREMEMBER\\n\\nINTRODUCTORY REMARKS\\n\\nAlways action receipt of Vendor terms and conditions by rejecting them and asserting AZ terms.\\n\\nIn certain situations, it is common for businesses to trade on their standard terms and conditions or purchase order terms. it is the same for AstraZeneca.\\n\\nWe should avoid contracting on Vendor standard terms.\\n\\nVendor standard terms will be more favourable to the Vendor and will not have the necessary requirements of AZ.\\nWe have two options: 1. Accept to do business on the Vendor’s standard terms 2. Reject the Vendor’s standard terms and assert the AZ terms.\\n\\nWhere option 1 is chosen, the Vendor’s terms must be reviewed first and amended where necessary to protect AZ and mitigate risk. This will take time and resource. For that reason, it is advisable to select option 2 and reject the Vendor’s terms and assert the AZ terms.\\n\\nPage 22 of 144\\n\\nCOMMON QUESTIONS & PUSH BACKS\\n\\nQs & PUSHBACKS 1. Supplier refuses standard terms.\\nTo reduce the length of the MSA, definitions and standard clauses which are not usually negotiated or contentious are included in the AZ Interpretation Policy – this is included as a link to the policy. If any Supplier questions where the standard interpretation policy or boiler plate language is, you should direct them to this link. This should not be amended and you should push back on any changes. It is not however, expected that these will be negotiated.',\n",
